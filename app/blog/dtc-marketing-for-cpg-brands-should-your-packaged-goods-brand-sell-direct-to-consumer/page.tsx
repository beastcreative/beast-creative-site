const faqs = [
  {
    question: "What is the main reason CPG brands should consider a DTC channel even if retail is the primary revenue driver?",
    answer: "DTC gives you owned customer data — email, purchase history, preferences — that retail channels never share with you, and this data makes every other marketing investment more effective. Brands with even a small DTC channel acquire customers 30–50% more efficiently on paid social than pure-retail brands because they can target lookalikes from their own buyer list.",
  },
  {
    question: "What CPG categories are best suited for DTC, and which categories struggle?",
    answer: "Subscription-friendly categories (supplements, pet food, coffee, personal care) are the strongest DTC fits because the repeat purchase model justifies customer acquisition costs over time. Low-price, low-involvement CPG (commoditized snacks, household consumables) struggles with DTC because the unit economics rarely support the shipping cost relative to price point.",
  },
  {
    question: "What customer acquisition cost is sustainable for a CPG DTC brand?",
    answer: "A CAC-to-LTV ratio of 1:3 or better is the standard benchmark — if it costs you $30 to acquire a customer, that customer should generate at least $90 in lifetime gross profit. For subscription CPG with predictable churn, this is achievable; for one-time-purchase CPG, achieving a 1:3 ratio is extremely difficult and most brands subsidize DTC as a data and brand-building investment rather than a profit center.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you decide whether to invest in DTC or put that budget into retail trade spend?",
    answer: "If your retail velocity is below category average, fix it with trade spend and sampling before opening a DTC channel — a DTC site requires consistent traffic investment and will not generate meaningful data if it is under-resourced. If your retail velocity is strong and you want to own the customer relationship and build a higher-value business, DTC investment is the right next step.",

              CPG brands are facing an unprecedented shift: traditional retail partnerships that once guaranteed shelf space and sales are no longer enough. Today’s packaged goods companies are discovering that direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels offer something retail can’t—complete control over customer relationships, brand narrative, and profit margins.

              <h2 className="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-beast-black mt-0 mb-4">The CPG DTC Revolution: Understanding the Landscape</h2>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">The direct-to-consumer model isn’t just for digitally native startups anymore. Established CPG brands are increasingly exploring DTC channels to complement their retail presence, driven by changing consumer behaviors and the limitations of traditional distribution.</p>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">Here’s what’s driving this shift: consumers want authentic brand experiences, personalized products, and direct relationships with the companies behind their favorite items. Meanwhile, retail margins continue to squeeze profitability, and brands find themselves competing for limited shelf space in an oversaturated market.</p>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">The reality is that DTC marketing for CPG brands requires a fundamentally different approach than traditional retail marketing. You’re not just promoting products—you’re building an entire customer experience from discovery to delivery.</p>

              <h3 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-beast-black mb-2 mt-6">Complete Customer Data Ownership</h3>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">When you sell through retail partners, you lose access to valuable customer data. DTC channels give you direct insight into:</p>

              <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Purchase patterns and frequency</li>

              </ul>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">This data becomes the foundation for AI-enhanced campaigns that can predict customer needs and personalize marketing messages at scale.</p>

              <h3 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-beast-black mb-2 mt-6">Higher Profit Margins</h3>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">Traditional retail partnerships typically involve significant markups, promotional fees, and slotting allowances that eat into your margins. DTC sales eliminate the middleman, allowing you to:</p>

              <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Capture full retail markup</li>
                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Control pricing strategies</li>

                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Offer subscription models for recurring revenue</li>
              </ul>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">Most businesses miss this: the margin improvement from DTC often more than compensates for higher customer acquisition costs, especially when you factor in customer lifetime value.</p>

              <h3 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-beast-black mb-2 mt-6">Brand Control and Storytelling</h3>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">Retail environments limit how you can present your brand story. DTC channels offer complete creative control over:</p>

              <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Product presentation and photography</li>
                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Brand messaging and tone</li>

              </ul>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">This control becomes especially valuable for brands with complex benefits or usage instructions that get lost in traditional retail settings.</p>

              <h2 className="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-beast-black mt-0 mb-4">Challenges CPG Brands Face in DTC Marketing</h2>

              <h3 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-beast-black mb-2 mt-6">Customer Acquisition Costs</h3>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">Here’s the thing: CPG products often have lower price points than typical DTC categories like beauty or electronics. This creates a challenging math problem where customer acquisition costs can quickly exceed first-purchase value.</p>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">Successful CPG DTC brands solve this by:</p>

              <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Focusing on customer lifetime value rather than first-purchase profitability</li>

              </ul>

              <h3 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-beast-black mb-2 mt-6">Fulfillment and Logistics</h3>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">CPG brands accustomed to palletized shipments to distribution centers must adapt to individual consumer fulfillment. This requires:</p>

              <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Different packaging designed for shipping</li>

              </ul>

              <h3 className="font-display text-xl font-bold text-beast-black mb-2 mt-6">Competing with Retail Partners</h3>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">This might surprise you: some retail partners view DTC efforts as direct competition. Successfully managing this relationship requires:</p>

              <ul className="space-y-2 mb-6">
                <li className="flex gap-3 text-[#4A4A4A] text-sm leading-relaxed"><span className="text-beast-pink font-bold shrink-0">→</span> Clear channel strategies and pricing policies</li>

              <h2 className="font-display text-3xl font-bold text-beast-black mt-0 mb-4">Conclusion: Taking the Next Step</h2>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">The question isn’t whether CPG brands should consider DTC marketing—it’s whether they can afford not to explore this growing opportunity. While DTC isn’t right for every CPG brand or every product line, the potential benefits of customer data ownership, margin improvement, and brand control make it worth serious consideration.</p>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">Success in CPG DTC marketing requires a different mindset than traditional retail marketing. It demands focus on customer lifetime value, investment in content and education, and commitment to delivering exceptional experiences at every touchpoint.</p>

              <p className="text-[#4A4A4A] leading-relaxed mb-4">Most importantly, don’t try to do everything at once. Start with your most promising products and most loyal customers. Test, learn, and iterate your way to a sustainable DTC strategy that complements your existing retail relationships.</p>
